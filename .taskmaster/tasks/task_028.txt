# Details:
1. Install Clerk Python SDK via `pip install clerk-sdk-python`
2. Create a dedicated Clerk service in the app/services directory
3. Update authentication dependencies to use Clerk session verification
4. Modify current auth router endpoints to leverage Clerk SDK
5. Update the User model to accommodate Clerk user properties
6. Implement proper session verification middleware
7. Update environment configuration for Clerk API keys
8. Document the authentication flow in the README
