# Task ID: 23
# Title: Develop Agent Management System
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 4, 25, 26
# Priority: high
# Description: Implement a comprehensive agent management system to handle agent lifecycle, capabilities, and operations.
# Details:
This task involves developing a robust agent management system that serves as the core execution layer for payment processing. The system should include the following components:

1. **Agent CRUD APIs**: Develop RESTful APIs to create, read, update, and delete agent records. Ensure these APIs are secure and scalable. The APIs must use synchronized Python models and maintain relationships as defined in Prisma, respecting organizationId-based multi-tenancy.

2. **Agent Wallet Creation**: Integrate with Thirdweb Engine to automatically create and manage wallets for each agent. Ensure wallets are securely stored and accessible. Wallet metadata must be stored consistently across both Prisma and SQLAlchemy.

3. **Agent Capability Configuration**: Implement functionality to configure agent capabilities, including supported providers, blockchain chains, and decision authority levels.

4. **Agent Assignment Logic**: Develop logic to assign tasks to agents based on their capabilities and current load. Implement load balancing to optimize performance.

5. **Agent Health Monitoring**: Create a system to monitor agent health and status, including uptime, response times, and error rates.

6. **Agent Decision Logging**: Implement logging for all agent decisions and actions to create an audit trail. Ensure logs are immutable and securely stored.

7. **Agent Performance Metrics**: Develop analytics to track agent performance, including transaction success rates, processing times, and throughput.

8. **Agent Version Control**: Implement version control for agent software, allowing for updates and rollbacks.

9. **Agent Communication Protocols**: Establish protocols for agent-to-agent communication, ensuring secure and efficient data exchange.

10. **Agent Marketplace Infrastructure**: Build infrastructure to support an agent marketplace, enabling dynamic agent deployment and scaling.

11. **Database Synchronization**: Ensure synchronization between Prisma and SQLAlchemy for key models: Agent, AgentDecision, AgentCheckpoint, AgentInteraction, and Wallet. FastAPI endpoints must return responses matching Prisma-generated TypeScript types.

Agents should operate autonomously, executing payments and making decisions based on their configuration and the data they process. Ensure all components are integrated with the existing system architecture and adhere to security best practices.

# Test Strategy:
1. **API Testing**: Use tools like Postman to test all CRUD operations for agents, ensuring they work as expected and handle edge cases. Verify that the APIs use synchronized models and maintain relationships as defined in Prisma.

2. **Wallet Verification**: Verify that wallets are correctly created and managed by Thirdweb Engine, checking for proper security and accessibility. Ensure wallet metadata is consistently stored across both ORMs.

3. **Capability Configuration Testing**: Test the configuration of agent capabilities to ensure they are correctly set and can be updated as needed.

4. **Assignment Logic Validation**: Simulate various load scenarios to test the agent assignment logic, ensuring tasks are distributed efficiently.

5. **Health Monitoring Checks**: Implement monitoring tools to verify that agent health metrics are accurately tracked and reported.

6. **Audit Trail Review**: Check that all agent decisions are logged correctly and that logs are immutable.

7. **Performance Metrics Analysis**: Analyze performance data to ensure metrics are accurate and provide meaningful insights.

8. **Version Control Testing**: Test agent updates and rollbacks to ensure version control works without disrupting operations.

9. **Communication Protocol Testing**: Simulate agent-to-agent communication to verify protocols are secure and efficient.

10. **Marketplace Functionality**: Test the agent marketplace infrastructure to ensure it supports dynamic deployment and scaling.

11. **Database Synchronization Testing**: Verify that the synchronization between Prisma and SQLAlchemy is accurate for all key models, and that FastAPI endpoints return responses matching Prisma-generated TypeScript types.
