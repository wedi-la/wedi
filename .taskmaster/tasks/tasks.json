Conduct a small-scale prototype if necessary to evaluate practical implications.\n<info added on 2025-06-08T06:22:19.286Z>\nCompleted evaluation of synchronization options with the following findings:\n\n## Option 1: Manual Synchronization\n**Pros:**\n- Full control over model implementation\n- Can optimize for FastAPI patterns\n- No external dependencies\n- Familiar SQLAlchemy patterns\n\n**Cons:**\n- Error-prone with 30+ models\n- Maintenance nightmare - every schema change requires manual sync\n- High risk of drift between Prisma and SQLAlchemy\n- Time-consuming implementation\n\n## Option 2: Code Generation\n**Pros:**\n- Automated sync reduces errors\n- Can be integrated into CI/CD\n- Maintains consistency automatically\n- One-time development effort\n\n**Cons:**\n- Complex to build generator that handles all Prisma features\n- Must handle: @map, @@map, Json fields, enums, relations\n- Edge cases may require manual intervention\n- Debugging generated code can be difficult\n\n## Option 3: Prisma Client Python\n**Pros:**\n- Official community solution exists (prisma-client-py)\n- Automatic type safety from Prisma schema\n- No manual sync needed - generates Python client from schema\n- Supports async/await natively\n- Active development and community support\n\n**Cons:**\n- Different API than SQLAlchemy (learning curve)\n- Less mature than SQLAlchemy\n- May have deployment complexities (seen Vercel issues)\n- Requires Rust bindings (additional dependency)\n\n## Recommendation: Prisma Client Python\nAfter evaluation, Prisma Client Python is the best option because:\n1. Eliminates sync issues entirely - single source of truth\n2. Provides type safety matching TypeScript frontend\n3. FastAPI integration is well-documented\n4. Active community with production usage\n5. Saves significant development time vs other options\n</info added on 2025-06-08T06:22:19.286Z>\n<info added on 2025-06-08T06:34:37.623Z>\nImplementation complete: Created a code generation approach using scripts/prisma-to-sqlalchemy/generator.py\n\nThe generator:\n- Parses the Prisma schema using regex patterns\n- Generates complete SQLAlchemy models with proper type mappings\n- Handles enums, relationships, indexes, and constraints\n- Fixes reserved field names (metadata -> metadata_)\n- Properly formats __table_args__ tuples\n- Imports func from sqlalchemy.sql for default values\n\nGenerated 28 models and 22 enums successfully.

Eliminates Synchronization Problem\n- No manual sync needed between Prisma and Python\n- Single source of truth (Prisma schema)\n- Zero risk of model drift\n\n### 2. Type Safety & Developer Experience\n- Automatic Python type hints from Prisma schema\n- Matches TypeScript types in frontend\n- Better IDE support with autocompletion\n\n### 3. FastAPI Compatibility\n- Native async/await support\n- Well-documented FastAPI integration patterns\n- Active community using it with FastAPI\n\n### 4. Time & Cost Efficiency\n- Immediate implementation vs weeks for manual/generator\n- Lower maintenance burden\n- Proven solution vs custom development\n\n### 5. Production Ready\n- Used by companies in production\n- Active maintenance and updates\n- Growing ecosystem\n\n## Implementation Plan:\n1. Install prisma-client-py package\n2. Update Prisma schema generator\n3. Integrate with FastAPI\n4. Remove existing SQLAlchemy models\n5. Update all database operations\n\n## Rejected Alternatives:\n- Manual sync: Too error-prone for 30+ models\n- Code generator: High development cost, edge case complexity\n</info added on 2025-06-08T06:22:49.499Z>",

Ensure proper validation and permission checks.\n<info added on 2025-06-08T23:49:51.303Z>\nStarting implementation of User Management Endpoints:\n\nAnalysis of requirements:\n1. Need CRUD endpoints for user management\n2. Must implement proper permission checks (users can view/edit their own profile, admins can manage all users)\n3. Should integrate with Clerk + Circle authentication\n4. Handle wallet addresses as part of user management\n5. Support user profile updates\n\nPlanned endpoints:\n- GET /api/v1/users/me - Get current user profile\n- PUT /api/v1/users/me - Update current user profile\n- DELETE /api/v1/users/me - Delete current user account\n- GET /api/v1/users - List users (admin only, with pagination)\n- GET /api/v1/users/{user_id} - Get specific user (admin only or self)\n- PUT /api/v1/users/{user_id} - Update user (admin only)\n- DELETE /api/v1/users/{user_id} - Delete user (admin only)\n- GET /api/v1/users/{user_id}/organizations - Get user's organizations\n- POST /api/v1/users/{user_id}/wallets - Add wallet to user\n- DELETE /api/v1/users/{user_id}/wallets/{wallet_id} - Remove wallet from user\n\nFiles to create:\n- app/routers/users.py - User endpoints\n- app/schemas/user.py - User schemas (may need to extend existing)\n\nWill leverage existing:\n- UserRepository with necessary methods\n- Authentication system from auth router\n- Multi-tenancy context where applicable\n</info added on 2025-06-08T23:49:51.303Z>\n<info added on 2025-06-08T23:52:11.342Z>\nSuccessfully implemented User Management Endpoints:\n\n1. Created comprehensive user router (app/routers/users.py):\n   - GET /api/v1/users/me - Get current user profile with organizations\n   - PUT /api/v1/users/me - Update current user profile\n   - DELETE /api/v1/users/me - Delete current user account (with safety checks)\n   - GET /api/v1/users - List users (admin only, with organization context)\n   - GET /api/v1/users/{user_id} - Get specific user (admin or self)\n   - PUT /api/v1/users/{user_id} - Update user (admin only)\n   - DELETE /api/v1/users/{user_id} - Remove user from organization (admin only)\n   - GET /api/v1/users/{user_id}/organizations - Get user's organizations\n   - POST /api/v1/users/{user_id}/wallets - Add wallet to user account\n   - DELETE /api/v1/users/{user_id}/wallets/{wallet_id} - Remove wallet from user\n\n2. Key Features:\n   - Full user profile management with proper permissions\n   - Wallet management integration for Web3 functionality\n   - Organization membership visibility\n   - Admin functionality with organization context support\n   - Account deletion with safety checks (prevents deletion if user owns organizations)\n   - Proper error handling and validation\n\n3. Security Features:\n   - Users can only modify their own profiles\n   - Admin permissions required for viewing/modifying other users\n   - Organization context enforced for admin operations\n   - Wallet ownership verification\n   - Protection against removing the only wallet\n\n4. Integration:\n   - Integrated with existing UserRepository and WalletRepository\n   - Uses Unit of Work pattern for transactional consistency\n   - Leverages existing authentication system\n   - Added router to v1 API module\n\nThe user management endpoints are now ready for testing and integration with the frontend, providing comprehensive user profile and wallet management capabilities.\n</info added on 2025-06-08T23:52:11.342Z>",
