Time & Cost Efficiency\n- Immediate implementation vs weeks for manual/generator\n- Lower maintenance burden\n- Proven solution vs custom development\n\n### 5. Production Ready\n- Used by companies in production\n- Active maintenance and updates\n- Growing ecosystem\n\n## Implementation Plan:\n1. Install prisma-client-py package\n2. Update Prisma schema generator\n3. Integrate with FastAPI\n4. Remove existing SQLAlchemy models\n5.
