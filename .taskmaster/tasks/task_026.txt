# Task ID: 26
# Title: Implement Repository Pattern and Database Layer
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 25
# Priority: high
# Description: Design and implement a repository pattern with a database layer using SQLAlchemy 2.0, supporting multi-tenancy, transaction management, and event emission.
# Details:
1. **Design Base Repository Pattern**: Implement a base repository class with generic CRUD operations using SQLAlchemy 2.0 with async support. Ensure it handles both read and write operations with proper transaction management.

2. **Domain-Specific Repositories**: Create repositories for each aggregate root such as User, Organization, Agent, PaymentLink, and PaymentOrder. These should extend the base repository and include domain-specific logic.

3. **Unit of Work Pattern**: Implement a Unit of Work pattern to manage transactions across multiple repositories. Ensure that it supports rollback and commit operations.

4. **Multi-Tenancy Middleware**: Develop middleware to automatically filter queries by organizationId, ensuring data isolation per tenant.

5. **Query Specification Pattern**: Implement a pattern to handle complex queries, allowing for flexible and reusable query logic.

6. **Database Session Management**: Set up session management and connection pooling to optimize database interactions.

7. **Repository Interfaces**: Define interfaces for repositories with async/await support to ensure non-blocking operations.

8. **Event Emission**: Integrate event emission after database operations to support Redpanda integration. Emit domain events after successful operations.

9. **Error Handling and Logging**: Implement comprehensive error handling and logging to capture and manage exceptions effectively.

10. **Row Level Security (RLS)**: Apply RLS patterns at the application level to ensure security and data integrity.

11. **Integration with SQLAlchemy Models**: Ensure integration with the SQLAlchemy models generated in Task 25, maintaining consistency with the database schema.

# Test Strategy:
1. **Unit Tests**: Write unit tests for each repository method using pytest to ensure CRUD operations work as expected.

2. **Integration Tests**: Develop integration tests to verify multi-tenancy middleware, transaction management, and event emission.

3. **Load Testing**: Conduct load testing to ensure connection pooling and session management handle concurrent requests efficiently.

4. **Security Testing**: Test RLS implementation to ensure data isolation and security.

5. **Logging Verification**: Check logs to ensure errors and events are captured correctly.

6. **Async Operations**: Verify that all repository operations support async/await and do not block the event loop.
