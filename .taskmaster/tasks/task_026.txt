# Task ID: 26
# Title: Implement Repository Pattern and Database Layer
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 25
# Priority: high
# Description: Design and implement a repository pattern with a database layer using SQLAlchemy 2.0, supporting multi-tenancy, transaction management, and event emission.
# Details:
1. **Design Base Repository Pattern**: Implemented a base repository class with generic CRUD operations using SQLAlchemy 2.0 with async support. Ensured it handles both read and write operations with proper transaction management.

2. **Domain-Specific Repositories**: Created repositories for each aggregate root such as User, Organization, Agent, PaymentLink, and PaymentOrder. These extend the base repository and include domain-specific logic.

3. **Unit of Work Pattern**: Implemented a Unit of Work pattern to manage transactions across multiple repositories, supporting rollback and commit operations.

4. **Multi-Tenancy Middleware**: Developed middleware to automatically filter queries by organizationId, ensuring data isolation per tenant.

5. **Query Specification Pattern**: Implemented a pattern to handle complex queries, allowing for flexible and reusable query logic.

6. **Database Session Management**: Set up session management and connection pooling to optimize database interactions.

7. **Repository Interfaces**: Defined interfaces for repositories with async/await support to ensure non-blocking operations.

8. **Event Emission**: Integrated event emission after database operations to support Redpanda integration. Emitted domain events after successful operations.

9. **Error Handling and Logging**: Implemented comprehensive error handling and logging to capture and manage exceptions effectively.

10. **Row Level Security (RLS)**: Applied RLS patterns at the application level to ensure security and data integrity.

11. **Integration with SQLAlchemy Models**: Ensured integration with the SQLAlchemy models generated in Task 25, maintaining consistency with the database schema.

# Test Strategy:
1. **Unit Tests**: Wrote unit tests for each repository method using pytest to ensure CRUD operations work as expected.

2. **Integration Tests**: Developed integration tests to verify multi-tenancy middleware, transaction management, and event emission.

3. **Load Testing**: Conducted load testing to ensure connection pooling and session management handle concurrent requests efficiently.

4. **Security Testing**: Tested RLS implementation to ensure data isolation and security.

5. **Logging Verification**: Checked logs to ensure errors and events are captured correctly.

6. **Async Operations**: Verified that all repository operations support async/await and do not block the event loop.

### Details:
Configure event publishers to emit domain events after successful CRUD operations.
<info added on 2025-06-08T16:47:21.207Z>
Successfully implemented Event Publisher Integration for domain events:

Created comprehensive event publishing infrastructure:
- Base DomainEvent class in app/events/publisher.py with event metadata (event_id, correlation_id, causation_id, occurred_at)
- Abstract EventPublisher interface with publish and publish_batch methods
- Three publisher implementations:
  - LoggingEventPublisher: Logs events for development/debugging
  - RedpandaEventPublisher: Kafka-compatible publisher for production with topic routing
  - InMemoryEventPublisher: For testing with event storage and retrieval

Created domain-specific event classes in app/events/domain_events.py:
- User events: UserCreatedEvent, UserVerifiedEvent, UserWalletLinkedEvent
- Organization events: OrganizationCreatedEvent, MemberAddedEvent, MemberRemovedEvent
- Payment events: PaymentOrderCreatedEvent, PaymentOrderProcessingEvent, PaymentOrderCompletedEvent, PaymentOrderFailedEvent
- Agent events: AgentCreatedEvent, AgentPerformanceRecordedEvent
- Wallet events: WalletCreatedEvent, WalletTransactionEvent
- Customer/Product events: CustomerCreatedEvent, CustomerKycUpdatedEvent, ProductCreatedEvent, ProductPriceUpdatedEvent

Created EventRepository base class (app/repositories/event_repository.py):
- Extends BaseRepository to automatically emit events after create/update/delete operations
- Tracks changes during updates to include in event data
- Provides hooks for subclasses to define which events to emit
- Example implementation in EventUserRepository shows practical usage

Configuration and startup (app/events/config.py):
- Configures event publisher based on environment settings
- Supports switching between logging, in-memory, and Redpanda publishers
- Startup/shutdown lifecycle management
- Fallback to logging publisher on configuration errors

Key design decisions:
- Events are published asynchronously after successful database operations
- Each aggregate type has its own Kafka topic (e.g., wedi.events.payment_order)
- Events include both data and metadata for traceability
- Repository pattern ensures consistent event emission across all entities
- Flexible configuration allows easy switching between development and production modes
