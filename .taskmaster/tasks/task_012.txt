# Task ID: 12
# Title: Develop Role-Based Access Control
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 4
# Priority: medium
# Description: Implement role-based access control for organization management with Thirdweb wallet-based authentication.
# Details:
Enhance the user management system to support role-based permissions and access control for different organization roles. Roles are tied to wallet addresses instead of traditional user IDs. Support smart contract wallets with delegated permissions and on-chain role verification for critical operations. Implement gas sponsorship permissions based on roles, wallet-specific API permissions for Engine access, and time-bound role assignments with expiration. Ensure multi-signature requirements for admin operations. The RBAC system should seamlessly work with both EOA wallets and smart contract wallets created through Thirdweb.

# Test Strategy:
Test access control by simulating actions with different wallet roles and verifying permission enforcement. Validate on-chain role verification and multi-signature requirements. Test gas sponsorship and API permissions for Engine access. Ensure time-bound role assignments expire correctly.
