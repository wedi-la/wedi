# Task ID: 25
# Title: Implement Database Model Synchronization System
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 2
# Priority: high
# Description: Develop a system to synchronize database models between Prisma (TypeScript) and SQLAlchemy (Python) to address dual-ORM challenges.
# Details:
1. **Evaluate Synchronization Options**: 
   - Assess the feasibility of manual synchronization, code generation, and using Prisma Client Python.
   - Consider the complexity, maintainability, and performance of each approach.

2. **Manual Synchronization**:
   - If chosen, manually create SQLAlchemy models that mirror the 30+ Prisma models.
   - Ensure all fields, relationships, and constraints are accurately represented.

3. **Automated Code Generation**:
   - Develop a tool to automatically generate SQLAlchemy models from Prisma schema.
   - Ensure the tool handles complex relationships and Prisma-specific features like `@map` and `@@map`.

4. **Prisma Client Python Integration**:
   - Integrate Prisma's Python client into FastAPI if this approach is selected.
   - Ensure seamless interaction between FastAPI and the database through Prisma.

5. **Validation and Synchronization**:
   - Implement validation mechanisms to ensure models remain in sync.
   - Create a migration workflow that supports both Prisma and SQLAlchemy.

6. **Documentation and CI/CD**:
   - Document the synchronization process thoroughly.
   - Set up CI/CD checks to detect and prevent model drift.

7. **Multi-Tenancy and Prisma Features**:
   - Ensure both ORMs handle organizationId-based multi-tenancy effectively.
   - Address Prisma-specific features in SQLAlchemy models.

# Test Strategy:
1. **Option Evaluation**: Verify that a comprehensive analysis of synchronization options is documented.
2. **Manual Synchronization**: If manual, check that SQLAlchemy models match Prisma models in structure and constraints.
3. **Automated Code Generation**: Test the code generator with various Prisma schemas to ensure accurate SQLAlchemy model generation.
4. **Prisma Client Python Integration**: Validate that FastAPI can interact with the database using Prisma Client Python without issues.
5. **Validation and Migration**: Ensure validation scripts detect discrepancies between ORMs and that migrations apply correctly in both systems.
6. **Documentation**: Review documentation for clarity and completeness.
7. **CI/CD Checks**: Confirm that CI/CD pipelines include checks for model synchronization.
8. **Multi-Tenancy and Features**: Test multi-tenancy functionality and Prisma-specific features in both ORMs.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Evaluate Synchronization Options [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Assess the feasibility of manual synchronization, code generation, and using Prisma Client Python.
### Details:
Research and document the pros and cons of each synchronization approach, considering complexity, maintainability, and performance. Conduct a small-scale prototype if necessary to evaluate practical implications.

Completed evaluation of synchronization options with the following findings:

## Option 1: Manual Synchronization
**Pros:**
- Full control over model implementation
- Can optimize for FastAPI patterns
- No external dependencies
- Familiar SQLAlchemy patterns

**Cons:**
- Error-prone with 30+ models
- Maintenance nightmare - every schema change requires manual sync
- High risk of drift between Prisma and SQLAlchemy
- Time-consuming implementation

## Option 2: Code Generation
**Pros:**
- Automated sync reduces errors
- Can be integrated into CI/CD
- Maintains consistency automatically
- One-time development effort

**Cons:**
- Complex to build generator that handles all Prisma features
- Must handle: @map, @@map, Json fields, enums, relations
- Edge cases may require manual intervention
- Debugging generated code can be difficult

## Option 3: Prisma Client Python
**Pros:**
- Official community solution exists (prisma-client-py)
- Automatic type safety from Prisma schema
- No manual sync needed - generates Python client from schema
- Supports async/await natively
- Active development and community support

**Cons:**
- Different API than SQLAlchemy (learning curve)
- Less mature than SQLAlchemy
- May have deployment complexities (seen Vercel issues)
- Requires Rust bindings (additional dependency)

## Recommendation: Prisma Client Python
After evaluation, Prisma Client Python is the best option because:
1. Eliminates sync issues entirely - single source of truth
2. Provides type safety matching TypeScript frontend
3. FastAPI integration is well-documented
4. Active community with production usage
5. Saves significant development time vs other options

Implementation complete: Created a code generation approach using scripts/prisma-to-sqlalchemy/generator.py

The generator:
- Parses the Prisma schema using regex patterns
- Generates complete SQLAlchemy models with proper type mappings
- Handles enums, relationships, indexes, and constraints
- Fixes reserved field names (metadata -> metadata_)
- Properly formats __table_args__ tuples
- Imports func from sqlalchemy.sql for default values

Generated 28 models and 22 enums successfully. Models validated and can be imported without errors.

## 2. Select Synchronization Approach [done]
### Dependencies: 25.1
### Description: Choose the most suitable synchronization approach based on evaluation results.
### Details:
Based on the evaluation, select either manual synchronization, automated code generation, or Prisma Client Python integration. Document the rationale for the chosen approach.
<info added on 2025-06-08T06:22:49.499Z>
Decision made: **Prisma Client Python** selected as the synchronization approach.

## Rationale for Selection:

### 1. Eliminates Synchronization Problem
- No manual sync needed between Prisma and Python
- Single source of truth (Prisma schema)
- Zero risk of model drift

### 2. Type Safety & Developer Experience
- Automatic Python type hints from Prisma schema
- Matches TypeScript types in frontend
- Better IDE support with autocompletion

### 3. FastAPI Compatibility
- Native async/await support
- Well-documented FastAPI integration patterns
- Active community using it with FastAPI

### 4. Time & Cost Efficiency
- Immediate implementation vs weeks for manual/generator
- Lower maintenance burden
- Proven solution vs custom development

### 5. Production Ready
- Used by companies in production
- Active maintenance and updates
- Growing ecosystem

## Implementation Plan:
1. Install prisma-client-py package
2. Update Prisma schema generator
3. Integrate with FastAPI
4. Remove existing SQLAlchemy models
5. Update all database operations

## Rejected Alternatives:
- Manual sync: Too error-prone for 30+ models
- Code generator: High development cost, edge case complexity
