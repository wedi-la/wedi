# Task ID: 27
# Title: Implement FastAPI Endpoint Structure with Dependency Injection
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 26
# Priority: high
# Description: Set up a FastAPI application structure with routers, dependency injection, and middleware for a RESTful API.
# Details:
1. **Set Up FastAPI Application Structure**: Initialize a FastAPI application with a modular structure using routers for different API sections (auth, organizations, users, etc.).

2. **Implement Dependency Injection**: Use FastAPI's dependency injection system to inject repositories into endpoints. Ensure each endpoint uses the repository pattern for data access and manipulation.

3. **Create DTOs with Pydantic**: Define request and response DTOs using Pydantic models for data validation and serialization.

4. **Implement Authentication Middleware**: Use JWT tokens for authentication. Implement middleware to validate JWTs and attach user information to requests.

5. **Organization Context Middleware**: Develop middleware to handle multi-tenancy by determining the organization context from request headers or tokens.

6. **API Versioning**: Set up API versioning by organizing endpoints under the `/api/v1` path.

7. **Error Handling and Exception Middleware**: Implement global error handling and exception middleware to standardize error responses.

8. **OpenAPI Documentation**: Automatically generate OpenAPI documentation with examples for each endpoint using FastAPI's built-in support.

9. **CORS Configuration**: Configure CORS to allow cross-origin requests from trusted domains.

10. **Request Validation and Sanitization**: Ensure all incoming requests are validated and sanitized to prevent injection attacks.

11. **RESTful Endpoint Design**: Implement endpoints following RESTful principles for authentication, organization management, user management, agent management, payment link CRUD, payment order tracking, customer management, product catalog, and webhook management. Ensure each endpoint emits events after state changes.

# Test Strategy:
1. **Unit Tests**: Write unit tests for each endpoint to verify correct routing, request handling, and response generation.

2. **Integration Tests**: Develop integration tests to ensure that dependency injection works correctly and that repositories are properly utilized.

3. **Middleware Tests**: Test authentication and organization context middleware to ensure they correctly process requests and attach necessary information.

4. **API Documentation Verification**: Check that the OpenAPI documentation is generated correctly and includes all endpoints with examples.

5. **Security Tests**: Conduct security testing to verify JWT validation, CORS configuration, and request sanitization.

6. **Functional Tests**: Perform end-to-end tests to ensure that the API endpoints function as expected and emit events correctly after state changes.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Initialize FastAPI Application [pending]

### Description: Set up the base FastAPI application with a modular structure.
### Details:
Create a new FastAPI project. Set up the main application file with an instance of FastAPI. Organize the project into directories for routers, models, and services.

## 2. Set Up Middleware Stack [pending]
### Dependencies: 27.1
### Description: Implement middleware for authentication and organization context.
### Details:
Add JWT authentication middleware to validate tokens and attach user information to requests. Implement organization context middleware to handle multi-tenancy.

## 3. Implement Dependency Injection [pending]
### Dependencies: 27.1
### Description: Set up dependency injection for repositories and services using FastAPI's dependency system.
### Details:
Define repository interfaces and implement them. Use FastAPI's Depends to inject these repositories into endpoint functions.

## 4. Create Pydantic DTOs [pending]
### Dependencies: 27.1
### Description: Define request and response DTOs using Pydantic models for data validation and serialization.
### Details:
Create Pydantic models for each entity (e.g., User, Organization) to be used in request and response bodies.

## 5. Implement Authentication Endpoints [pending]
### Dependencies: 27.2, 27.3, 27.4
### Description: Develop endpoints for user authentication under /api/v1/auth/*.
### Details:
Create routes for login, logout, and token refresh. Use JWTs for token management.

## 6. Implement Organization Management Endpoints [pending]
### Dependencies: 27.2, 27.3, 27.4
### Description: Develop endpoints for managing organizations under /api/v1/organizations/*.
### Details:
Create CRUD endpoints for organization management. Ensure endpoints respect organization context from middleware.

## 7. Implement User Management Endpoints [pending]
### Dependencies: 27.2, 27.3, 27.4
### Description: Develop endpoints for managing users under /api/v1/users/*.
### Details:
Create CRUD endpoints for user management. Ensure proper validation and permission checks.

## 8. Implement Payment Link Endpoints [pending]
### Dependencies: 27.2, 27.3, 27.4
### Description: Develop endpoints for managing payment links under /api/v1/payment-links/*.
### Details:
Create endpoints for creating, updating, and deleting payment links. Ensure data integrity and validation.

## 9. Set Up Error Handling and Exception Middleware [pending]
### Dependencies: 27.1
### Description: Implement global error handling and exception middleware to standardize error responses.
### Details:
Create custom exception handlers and middleware to catch and format exceptions consistently.

## 10. Configure OpenAPI Documentation [pending]
### Dependencies: 27.5, 27.6, 27.7, 27.8
### Description: Automatically generate OpenAPI documentation with examples for each endpoint.
### Details:
Use FastAPI's built-in support to generate and customize OpenAPI documentation. Add examples for clarity.

## 11. Implement Event Emission After State Changes [pending]
### Dependencies: 27.5, 27.6, 27.7, 27.8
### Description: Ensure each endpoint emits events after state changes.
### Details:
Integrate an event system to emit events (e.g., using a message broker) after successful state changes in endpoints.

## 12. Set Up Testing Structure for Endpoints [pending]
### Dependencies: 27.5, 27.6, 27.7, 27.8
### Description: Establish a testing framework for endpoint testing.
### Details:
Use a testing framework like pytest to create tests for all endpoints. Include tests for edge cases and error conditions.
