# Task ID: 27
# Title: Implement FastAPI Endpoint Structure with Dependency Injection
# Status: in-progress
# Dependencies: 26
# Priority: high
# Description: Set up a FastAPI application structure with routers, dependency injection, and middleware for a RESTful API.
# Details:
1. **Set Up FastAPI Application Structure**: Initialize a FastAPI application with a modular structure using routers for different API sections (auth, organizations, users, etc.).

2. **Implement Dependency Injection**: Use FastAPI's dependency injection system to inject repositories into endpoints. Ensure each endpoint uses the repository pattern for data access and manipulation.

3. **Create DTOs with Pydantic**: Define request and response DTOs using Pydantic models for data validation and serialization.

4. **Implement Authentication Middleware**: Use JWT tokens for authentication. Implement middleware to validate JWTs and attach user information to requests.

5. **Organization Context Middleware**: Develop middleware to handle multi-tenancy by determining the organization context from request headers or tokens.

6. **API Versioning**: Set up API versioning by organizing endpoints under the `/api/v1` path.

7. **Error Handling and Exception Middleware**: Implement global error handling and exception middleware to standardize error responses.

8. **OpenAPI Documentation**: Automatically generate OpenAPI documentation with examples for each endpoint using FastAPI's built-in support.

9. **CORS Configuration**: Configure CORS to allow cross-origin requests from trusted domains.

10. **Request Validation and Sanitization**: Ensure all incoming requests are validated and sanitized to prevent injection attacks.

11. **RESTful Endpoint Design**: Implement endpoints following RESTful principles for authentication, organization management, user management, agent management, payment link CRUD, payment order tracking, customer management, product catalog, and webhook management. Ensure each endpoint emits events after state changes.

# Test Strategy:
1. **Unit Tests**: Write unit tests for each endpoint to verify correct routing, request handling, and response generation.

2. **Integration Tests**: Develop integration tests to ensure that dependency injection works correctly and that repositories are properly utilized.

3. **Middleware Tests**: Test authentication and organization context middleware to ensure they correctly process requests and attach necessary information.

4. **API Documentation Verification**: Check that the OpenAPI documentation is generated correctly and includes all endpoints with examples.

5. **Security Tests**: Conduct security testing to verify JWT validation, CORS configuration, and request sanitization.

6. **Functional Tests**: Perform end-to-end tests to ensure that the API endpoints function as expected and emit events correctly after state changes.

Initial Analysis and Implementation Plan for Thirdweb Authentication Integration:

Based on thirdweb documentation analysis:
1. Thirdweb Auth uses Sign-In with Ethereum (SIWE) standard for passwordless authentication
2. Frontend uses thirdweb ConnectButton with auth configuration
3. Backend needs to:
   - Generate SIWE payloads for login
   - Verify signed payloads using thirdweb/auth
   - Issue JWT tokens for session management
   - Handle refresh tokens and logout

Implementation approach:
- Create auth router at /api/v1/auth/*
- Endpoints needed:
  - POST /api/v1/auth/payload - Generate SIWE payload
  - POST /api/v1/auth/login - Verify signature and issue JWT
  - POST /api/v1/auth/refresh - Refresh access token
  - POST /api/v1/auth/logout - Invalidate session
  - GET /api/v1/auth/me - Get current user info
- Integrate with existing JWT middleware from Task 27.2
- Use thirdweb/auth library for SIWE handling
- Store sessions in database with proper cleanup

Files to create/modify:
- app/routers/auth.py - Authentication endpoints
- app/services/auth_service.py - Business logic for auth
- app/api/v1/__init__.py - Include auth router
- Update main.py to register auth routes
</info added on 2025-06-08T19:47:38.594Z>
<info added on 2025-06-08T19:55:52.592Z>

   - Generates SIWE payloads compatible with thirdweb frontend
   - Handles user login with wallet address (creates user if not exists)
   - Issues JWT tokens for session management
   - Supports token refresh and logout
   - Retrieves current user information

2. Created auth schemas (app/schemas/auth.py):
   - SIWEPayloadRequest/Response for SIWE message generation
   - LoginRequest/Response for authentication flow
   - TokenRefreshRequest/Response for token management
   - CurrentUserResponse for user info endpoint

3. Created auth router (app/routers/auth.py):
   - POST /api/v1/auth/payload - Generate SIWE payload
   - POST /api/v1/auth/login - Verify signature and issue JWT
   - POST /api/v1/auth/refresh - Refresh access token
   - POST /api/v1/auth/logout - Logout endpoint
   - GET /api/v1/auth/me - Get current user info

4. Updated infrastructure:
   - Created v1 router in app/api/v1/__init__.py
   - Updated main.py to include v1 router
   - Added FRONTEND_URL and ALLOWED_HOSTS to config

5. Key design decisions:
   - Users created from wallet automatically get verified email status
   - Wallet is created separately and linked as primary wallet
   - Organizations are fetched from user repository
   - Auth endpoints are public except /me and /logout which require JWT

Note: Signature verification is placeholder - in production would use web3 libraries to verify SIWE signatures.

All endpoints are now ready for integration with thirdweb frontend ConnectButton.

8. Successfully resolved database compatibility issues:
   - Created custom ArrayType and JSONType for cross-database support
   - Updated Prisma to SQLAlchemy generator to use custom types
   - Fixed circular dependency issues between User and Wallet models

9. Tests are now running successfully - first test is passing!
