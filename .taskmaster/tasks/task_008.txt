# Task ID: 8
# Title: Develop Real-Time Transaction Tracking
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 7
# Priority: medium
# Description: Implement real-time transaction tracking using Kafka for event-driven updates.
# Details:
Set up Kafka for event streaming and implement event handlers for transaction status updates. Develop a dashboard for live transaction monitoring.

# Test Strategy:
Test real-time updates by simulating transaction events and verifying dashboard updates and notifications.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Set Up Redpanda Cloud Managed Kafka Service [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Provision and configure a Redpanda Cloud managed Kafka service to handle real-time transaction events.
### Details:
Choose between BYOC (Bring Your Own Cloud) or Dedicated clusters based on data sovereignty and compliance requirements. Configure the cluster to meet performance and scalability needs.

## 2. Define Event Schemas for Payment Events [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Design and document schemas for all payment-related events to ensure consistent data structure across the system.
### Details:
Utilize a schema registry to manage and version event schemas, ensuring compatibility and ease of evolution over time.

## 3. Implement Event Producers in FastAPI [pending]
### Dependencies: 8.1, 8.2
### Description: Develop FastAPI endpoints that produce payment events and publish them to the Redpanda Kafka topics.
### Details:
Use the aiokafka library to integrate Kafka producers within FastAPI, ensuring asynchronous and efficient event publishing.

## 4. Create Event Consumers for Real-Time Updates [pending]
### Dependencies: 8.1, 8.2
### Description: Develop consumers that subscribe to payment event topics and process events for real-time transaction tracking.
### Details:
Implement consumers using aiokafka to handle event processing, ensuring they can scale and handle high-throughput scenarios.

## 5. Build WebSocket/SSE Endpoints for UI Updates [pending]
### Dependencies: 8.3, 8.4
### Description: Create WebSocket or Server-Sent Events (SSE) endpoints in FastAPI to push real-time transaction updates to the user interface.
### Details:
Leverage FastAPI's support for WebSockets and SSE to establish persistent connections with clients, enabling instant updates.

## 6. Implement Event Sourcing and Replay Capabilities [pending]
### Dependencies: 8.1, 8.2
### Description: Design the system to support event sourcing, allowing for the reconstruction of transaction states and replaying events as needed.
### Details:
Utilize Redpanda's tiered storage to retain events indefinitely, enabling historical analysis and system state reconstruction.

## 7. Implement Dead Letter Queue Handling [pending]
### Dependencies: 8.4
### Description: Set up mechanisms to handle events that cannot be processed successfully, ensuring they are logged and retried appropriately.
### Details:
Configure dead letter queues within Redpanda to capture failed events, and implement retry logic to process them after resolving issues.
