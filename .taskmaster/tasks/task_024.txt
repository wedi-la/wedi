# Task ID: 24
# Title: Implement Customer and Product Management
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 4, 23, 25, 26
# Priority: high
# Description: Develop a comprehensive system for managing customers, products, and pricing, supporting both one-time payments and subscriptions. Ensure synchronization between Prisma and SQLAlchemy for key data models.
# Details:
This task involves creating a robust system for customer and product management, similar to Stripe's model. Key components include:

1. **Customer CRUD APIs**: Develop RESTful APIs to create, read, update, and delete customer records. Ensure these APIs are secure and scalable.

2. **Payment Method Management**: Implement secure storage and management of customer payment methods, integrating with existing payment gateways.

3. **Product Catalog Management**: Design a flexible product catalog system that allows for dynamic attribute management.

4. **Price Management**: Support both one-time and recurring pricing models, including price tiers and volume discounts.

5. **Subscription Management**: Implement APIs for creating and managing subscriptions, including recurring payment scheduling.

6. **Customer Portal**: Develop a self-service portal for customers to manage their accounts, view invoices, and update payment methods.

7. **Product Analytics**: Integrate analytics to track product usage and customer interactions.

8. **Multi-Currency Support**: Implement multi-currency price lists to support global transactions.

9. **Database Synchronization**: Ensure perfect synchronization between Prisma and SQLAlchemy for key models:
   - Customer (with relationships to organizations)
   - Product (with flexible metadata)
   - Price (supporting one-time and recurring models)
   - Subscription (with billing cycles and status)
   - CustomerPaymentMethod (secure storage)
   - SubscriptionSchedule (for plan changes)

   FastAPI endpoints must use synchronized Python models from Task 25. Handle Prisma's Json fields appropriately in SQLAlchemy, maintain exact relationships (Customer → PaymentMethods, Product → Prices), ensure decimal precision matches for currency amounts, handle Prisma enums (PriceType, SubscriptionStatus) in Python, and ensure multi-tenant isolation via organizationId works in both ORMs.

Ensure the system is integrated with the existing multi-tenancy and authentication frameworks, leveraging the core database schema and organization management features. The Stripe-like API design should return responses that match Prisma-generated TypeScript types for frontend consistency.

# Test Strategy:
1. **API Testing**: Use Postman or similar tools to test all customer and product management APIs for CRUD operations, ensuring correct data handling and security.

2. **Payment Method Validation**: Verify that payment methods are securely stored and can be updated by customers through the portal.

3. **Subscription Lifecycle**: Test subscription creation, renewal, and cancellation processes, ensuring correct billing and notifications.

4. **Portal Functionality**: Conduct user testing on the customer portal to ensure intuitive navigation and functionality.

5. **Analytics Verification**: Check that product usage data is accurately captured and reported.

6. **Multi-Currency Transactions**: Simulate transactions in different currencies to ensure correct pricing and conversion.

7. **Integration Testing**: Ensure seamless integration with existing systems for authentication and organization management.

8. **Database Synchronization Testing**: Verify that data models are perfectly synchronized between Prisma and SQLAlchemy, including handling of Json fields, enums, and decimal precision. Test multi-tenant isolation and ensure API responses match Prisma-generated TypeScript types.
