# Task ID: 22
# Title: Implement Web3 Payment Infrastructure with Thirdweb
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 2, 3, 4, 21
# Priority: high
# Description: Develop a comprehensive Web3 payment system using Thirdweb, including smart contract wallets, gas sponsorship, payment contracts, and transaction monitoring.
# Details:
1. Set up smart contract wallets for organizations, including treasury and operations wallets, using Thirdweb's wallet management tools. Ensure these wallets are securely integrated with the organization's account.
2. Implement gas sponsorship for user transactions using Thirdweb Engine, allowing organizations to cover transaction fees for users. Configure sponsorship policies and ensure they are enforced through the backend.
3. Create payment smart contracts to handle escrow and automated settlements. Use Solidity to define contract logic and deploy these contracts on the blockchain. Ensure contracts are secure and audited.
4. Integrate Thirdweb's session keys for delegated payments, allowing users to authorize payments without exposing private keys. Implement session management and key rotation strategies.
5. Develop a system for generating payment links with on-chain metadata. Ensure links are secure, easily shareable, and trackable.
6. Set up a webhook system to monitor blockchain transactions and trigger backend processes. Use Thirdweb's webhook capabilities to receive real-time updates on transaction statuses.
7. Implement fallback mechanisms for failed transactions, including retries, user notifications, and manual intervention options. Ensure the system can gracefully handle errors and maintain data integrity.

# Test Strategy:
1. Verify that smart contract wallets are correctly set up and integrated with organization accounts by checking wallet addresses and balances.
2. Test gas sponsorship by executing user transactions and confirming that fees are covered by the organization. Validate sponsorship policies through transaction logs.
3. Deploy payment smart contracts on a test network and conduct escrow and settlement transactions. Verify contract logic and security through audits and test cases.
4. Test session key integration by performing delegated payments and ensuring keys are managed securely. Check for proper session expiration and key rotation.
5. Generate payment links and confirm they contain correct on-chain metadata. Test link sharing and tracking functionality.
6. Simulate blockchain transactions and ensure webhooks trigger appropriate backend processes. Verify real-time transaction monitoring and logging.
7. Induce transaction failures and test fallback mechanisms, including retries and notifications. Ensure system stability and data consistency during error handling.
