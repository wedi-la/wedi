# Task ID: 7
# Title: Implement Payment Execution Logic
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 6
# Priority: high
# Description: Develop the logic for executing payments through autonomous AI agents using LangGraph.
# Details:
Create an agent-centric architecture where autonomous AI agents handle payment execution. Each agent listens for Payment.Initiated events from Redpanda, uses its own Thirdweb smart wallet for blockchain operations, and orchestrates the entire payment flow. Agents select providers based on capabilities, handle callbacks/webhooks, emit terminal events, and log all reasoning and decisions for auditability. The system is event-driven with agents as primary consumers, making decisions based on provider availability, transaction parameters, success rates, and cost optimization.

# Test Strategy:
Test payment execution with various scenarios using autonomous agents, including successful and failed transactions. Verify agent decision-making, provider selection, and event emission. Ensure audit logs are comprehensive.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Design Payment State Machine [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Develop a state machine to manage payment states: CREATED, AWAITING_PAYMENT, PROCESSING, COMPLETED, and FAILED.
### Details:
Define state transitions and ensure consistency across the payment lifecycle.

## 2. Implement Provider Routing Logic for Colombia-Mexico Corridor [pending]
### Dependencies: 7.1
### Description: Develop logic to route payments between Colombia and Mexico through appropriate providers.
### Details:
Analyze provider capabilities and establish routing rules for optimal transaction processing.

## 3. Implement Idempotency Handling for Payment Operations [pending]
### Dependencies: 7.1
### Description: Ensure all payment operations are idempotent to prevent duplicate processing.
### Details:
Generate unique idempotency keys and store operation results to handle retries gracefully.

## 4. Set Up Transaction Event Emission to Kafka [pending]
### Dependencies: 7.1
### Description: Configure the system to emit transaction events to a Kafka topic for downstream processing.
### Details:
Define event schemas and integrate Kafka producers to publish payment state changes.

## 5. Develop Fee Calculation and Breakdown Tracking [pending]
### Dependencies: 7.1
### Description: Implement logic to calculate transaction fees and track their breakdown for transparency.
### Details:
Define fee structures and ensure accurate computation and recording of fees for each transaction.

## 6. Implement Exchange Rate Locking Mechanism [pending]
### Dependencies: 7.1
### Description: Develop a mechanism to lock exchange rates during transactions to mitigate currency fluctuation risks.
### Details:
Integrate with exchange rate providers and store locked rates for the duration of the transaction.

## 7. Develop Provider API Integration Layer [pending]
### Dependencies: 7.1
### Description: Create an abstraction layer to integrate with various payment providers' APIs.
### Details:
Standardize API interactions and handle provider-specific nuances for seamless integration.

## 8. Implement Error Handling and Retry Logic [pending]
### Dependencies: 7.1
### Description: Develop robust error handling and retry mechanisms for payment operations.
### Details:
Classify errors, implement retries for transient failures, and ensure system resilience.

## 9. Design Manual Intervention Workflow [pending]
### Dependencies: 7.1
### Description: Establish a workflow for manual intervention in case of payment processing issues.
### Details:
Define procedures and tools for operators to resolve payment exceptions effectively.

## 10. Implement Payment Order Status Synchronization [pending]
### Dependencies: 7.1
### Description: Ensure synchronization of payment order statuses across all system components.
### Details:
Develop mechanisms to update and propagate payment statuses to maintain consistency.

## 11. Develop Autonomous Agent Architecture [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create the architecture for autonomous AI agents to handle payment execution.
### Details:
Design agents to listen for Payment.Initiated events, use Thirdweb smart wallets, and orchestrate payment flows autonomously.

## 12. Implement Agent Decision-Making Logic [pending]
### Dependencies: 7.11
### Description: Develop logic for agents to make decisions based on provider availability, transaction parameters, and performance metrics.
### Details:
Ensure agents can select providers and optimize costs while maintaining high success rates.

## 13. Set Up Event-Driven System with Redpanda [pending]
### Dependencies: 7.11
### Description: Configure the system to use Redpanda for event-driven architecture with agents as primary consumers.
### Details:
Ensure agents can consume Payment.Initiated events and emit terminal events like Payment.Succeeded and Payment.Failed.

## 14. Implement Logging and Auditability for Agents [pending]
### Dependencies: 7.11
### Description: Ensure all agent decisions and actions are logged for auditability.
### Details:
Develop comprehensive logging mechanisms to capture agent reasoning and decision-making processes.
