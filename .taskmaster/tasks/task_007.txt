# Task ID: 7
# Title: Implement Payment Execution Logic
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 6
# Priority: high
# Description: Develop the logic for executing payments through integrated providers.
# Details:
Create a service to handle payment execution, including provider selection, transaction initiation, and status tracking. Implement retry logic for failed transactions.

# Test Strategy:
Test payment execution with various scenarios, including successful and failed transactions, and verify retry mechanisms.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Design Payment State Machine [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Develop a state machine to manage payment states: CREATED, AWAITING_PAYMENT, PROCESSING, COMPLETED, and FAILED.
### Details:
Define state transitions and ensure consistency across the payment lifecycle.

## 2. Implement Provider Routing Logic for Colombia-Mexico Corridor [pending]
### Dependencies: 7.1
### Description: Develop logic to route payments between Colombia and Mexico through appropriate providers.
### Details:
Analyze provider capabilities and establish routing rules for optimal transaction processing.

## 3. Implement Idempotency Handling for Payment Operations [pending]
### Dependencies: 7.1
### Description: Ensure all payment operations are idempotent to prevent duplicate processing.
### Details:
Generate unique idempotency keys and store operation results to handle retries gracefully.

## 4. Set Up Transaction Event Emission to Kafka [pending]
### Dependencies: 7.1
### Description: Configure the system to emit transaction events to a Kafka topic for downstream processing.
### Details:
Define event schemas and integrate Kafka producers to publish payment state changes.

## 5. Develop Fee Calculation and Breakdown Tracking [pending]
### Dependencies: 7.1
### Description: Implement logic to calculate transaction fees and track their breakdown for transparency.
### Details:
Define fee structures and ensure accurate computation and recording of fees for each transaction.

## 6. Implement Exchange Rate Locking Mechanism [pending]
### Dependencies: 7.1
### Description: Develop a mechanism to lock exchange rates during transactions to mitigate currency fluctuation risks.
### Details:
Integrate with exchange rate providers and store locked rates for the duration of the transaction.

## 7. Develop Provider API Integration Layer [pending]
### Dependencies: 7.1
### Description: Create an abstraction layer to integrate with various payment providers' APIs.
### Details:
Standardize API interactions and handle provider-specific nuances for seamless integration.

## 8. Implement Error Handling and Retry Logic [pending]
### Dependencies: 7.1
### Description: Develop robust error handling and retry mechanisms for payment operations.
### Details:
Classify errors, implement retries for transient failures, and ensure system resilience.

## 9. Design Manual Intervention Workflow [pending]
### Dependencies: 7.1
### Description: Establish a workflow for manual intervention in case of payment processing issues.
### Details:
Define procedures and tools for operators to resolve payment exceptions effectively.

## 10. Implement Payment Order Status Synchronization [pending]
### Dependencies: 7.1
### Description: Ensure synchronization of payment order statuses across all system components.
### Details:
Develop mechanisms to update and propagate payment statuses to maintain consistency.
