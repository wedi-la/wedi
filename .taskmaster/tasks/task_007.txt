# Task ID: 7
# Title: Implement Payment Execution Logic
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 6
# Priority: high
# Description: Develop the logic for executing payments through integrated providers.
# Details:
Create a service to handle payment execution, including provider selection, transaction initiation, and status tracking. Implement retry logic for failed transactions.

# Test Strategy:
Test payment execution with various scenarios, including successful and failed transactions, and verify retry mechanisms.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Create Execution Service [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Develop the core execution service to handle payment transactions.
### Details:
Design and implement the execution service that will manage the payment transactions between Colombia and Mexico. This service should be capable of handling requests, processing payments, and ensuring reliable execution.

## 2. Implement Provider Selection [pending]
### Dependencies: 7.1
### Description: Develop logic to select the appropriate payment provider for transactions.
### Details:
Create a mechanism to select the best payment provider based on criteria such as cost, reliability, and availability. This should be integrated into the execution service.

## 3. Develop Transaction Initiation and Idempotent Processing [pending]
### Dependencies: 7.1, 7.2
### Description: Implement transaction initiation logic with idempotent processing.
### Details:
Ensure that transaction initiation is robust and idempotent, meaning that repeated requests do not result in duplicate transactions. This includes generating unique transaction IDs and handling repeated requests gracefully.

## 4. Implement State Machine for Payment Status and Error Handling [pending]
### Dependencies: 7.1, 7.3
### Description: Create a state machine to track payment status and handle errors.
### Details:
Design a state machine that tracks the status of payments from initiation to completion. Implement error handling to manage failures and retries, ensuring that the system can recover from errors without data loss.

## 5. Handle Provider Webhooks and Publish Events to Kafka [pending]
### Dependencies: 7.1, 7.4
### Description: Implement webhook handling for provider notifications and event publishing to Kafka.
### Details:
Develop functionality to handle incoming webhooks from payment providers, updating the payment status accordingly. Additionally, implement event publishing to Kafka to ensure that payment events are communicated to other systems.
