# Task ID: 21
# Title: Integrate Thirdweb Engine with FastAPI Backend
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1, 2, 3
# Priority: high
# Description: Integrate Thirdweb Engine with the FastAPI backend following the v2 documentation, including setup, token management, API client implementation, wallet management, transaction monitoring, webhook creation, and concurrent transaction handling.
# Details:
1. Set up Thirdweb Engine Cloud or self-hosted instance according to https://portal.thirdweb.com/engine/v2 documentation.
2. Create Engine access tokens and configure appropriate permissions for backend operations.
3. Implement a Python client to interact with Engine API endpoints, ensuring all necessary functionality is accessible from the FastAPI backend.
4. Set up backend wallet management through the Engine, including secure storage and usage of wallets for transactions.
5. Implement transaction queue monitoring to track the status of outgoing transactions.
6. Create webhook endpoints in the FastAPI backend to handle Engine callbacks for transaction events.
7. Handle concurrent transactions with automatic nonce management to prevent conflicts.

Ensure all components are properly integrated and tested within the existing FastAPI architecture, following best practices for security and performance.

# Test Strategy:
1. Verify that Thirdweb Engine is correctly set up and accessible from the backend.
2. Test token creation and permission configuration by attempting API calls with different tokens.
3. Validate Python client implementation by successfully calling all Engine API endpoints.
4. Confirm wallet management functionality by creating, retrieving, and using wallets for test transactions.
5. Check transaction queue monitoring by submitting transactions and verifying their status updates.
6. Test webhook endpoints by triggering Engine callbacks and verifying proper handling of events.
7. Verify concurrent transaction handling by simulating multiple simultaneous transactions and checking for correct nonce management.

Perform integration testing to ensure all components work together seamlessly within the FastAPI backend.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Set Up Thirdweb Engine Instance [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Deploy and configure a Thirdweb Engine instance, either cloud-hosted or self-hosted, following the v2 documentation.
### Details:
Choose between a cloud-hosted or self-hosted Thirdweb Engine instance. For self-hosting, ensure Docker, PostgresDB (version 14+), and Redis (version 7.2.4+) are installed. Follow the setup instructions provided in the Thirdweb Engine v2 documentation.

## 2. Generate and Configure Engine Access Tokens [pending]
### Dependencies: 21.1
### Description: Create access tokens with appropriate permissions for backend operations.
### Details:
In the Thirdweb dashboard, navigate to the Engine section and generate access tokens. Assign necessary permissions to these tokens to enable backend operations.

## 3. Implement Python Client for Engine API [pending]
### Dependencies: 21.2
### Description: Develop a Python client to interact with Thirdweb Engine API endpoints from the FastAPI backend.
### Details:
Utilize the Thirdweb Engine API documentation to implement a Python client that can perform necessary operations such as deploying contracts, sending transactions, and querying data.

## 4. Set Up Backend Wallet Management [pending]
### Dependencies: 21.3
### Description: Configure secure storage and management of backend wallets for transaction processing.
### Details:
Create or import backend wallets within the Engine dashboard. Ensure secure storage practices are followed, such as using AWS KMS or Google Cloud KMS for key management.

## 5. Implement Transaction Monitoring and Webhooks [pending]
### Dependencies: 21.4
### Description: Set up monitoring for transaction statuses and create webhook endpoints to handle Engine callbacks.
### Details:
Configure the FastAPI backend to monitor transaction queues and statuses. Implement webhook endpoints to receive and process callbacks from the Engine for transaction events.

## 6. Handle Concurrent Transactions with Nonce Management [pending]
### Dependencies: 21.5
### Description: Implement mechanisms to manage concurrent transactions and prevent nonce conflicts.
### Details:
Utilize the Engine's built-in nonce management features to handle multiple transactions simultaneously without conflicts. Ensure the FastAPI backend is configured to support concurrent transaction processing.
