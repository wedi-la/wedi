# Task ID: 21
# Title: Integrate Thirdweb Engine with FastAPI Backend
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1, 2, 3
# Priority: high
# Description: Integrate Thirdweb Engine with the FastAPI backend to focus on agent wallet infrastructure, including setup, agent wallet creation, gas sponsorship, multi-signature support, wallet monitoring, transaction queuing, nonce management, and webhook integration.
# Details:
1. Set up Thirdweb Engine Cloud or self-hosted instance according to https://portal.thirdweb.com/engine/v2 documentation.
2. Create smart contract wallets for each autonomous payment agent via the Engine.
3. Implement gas sponsorship capabilities to allow agents to execute transactions without direct gas costs.
4. Enable multi-signature support for high-value operations to enhance security.
5. Monitor wallet balances and manage wallets effectively, including allowlists and blocklists.
6. Implement transaction queue monitoring and nonce management to handle concurrent operations.
7. Create webhook endpoints in the FastAPI backend to handle Engine callbacks for transaction status updates.

Ensure all components are properly integrated and tested within the existing FastAPI architecture, following best practices for security and performance.

# Test Strategy:
1. Verify that Thirdweb Engine is correctly set up and accessible from the backend.
2. Test the creation and management of agent wallets, ensuring each wallet is correctly configured.
3. Validate gas sponsorship by executing transactions and confirming that gas costs are covered.
4. Confirm multi-signature functionality by requiring multiple approvals for high-value transactions.
5. Check wallet monitoring by tracking balance changes and managing allowlists/blocklists.
6. Verify transaction queuing and nonce management by simulating multiple concurrent transactions.
7. Test webhook endpoints by triggering Engine callbacks and verifying proper handling of transaction status updates.

Perform integration testing to ensure all components work together seamlessly within the FastAPI backend.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Set Up Thirdweb Engine Instance [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Deploy and configure a Thirdweb Engine instance, either cloud-hosted or self-hosted, following the v2 documentation.
### Details:
Choose between a cloud-hosted or self-hosted Thirdweb Engine instance. For self-hosting, ensure Docker, PostgresDB (version 14+), and Redis (version 7.2.4+) are installed. Follow the setup instructions provided in the Thirdweb Engine v2 documentation.

## 2. Generate and Configure Engine Access Tokens [pending]
### Dependencies: 21.1
### Description: Create access tokens with appropriate permissions for backend operations.
### Details:
In the Thirdweb dashboard, navigate to the Engine section and generate access tokens. Assign necessary permissions to these tokens to enable backend operations.

## 3. Implement Python Client for Engine API [pending]
### Dependencies: 21.2
### Description: Develop a Python client to interact with Thirdweb Engine API endpoints from the FastAPI backend.
### Details:
Utilize the Thirdweb Engine API documentation to implement a Python client that can perform necessary operations such as deploying contracts, sending transactions, and querying data.

## 4. Set Up Backend Wallet Management [pending]
### Dependencies: 21.3
### Description: Configure secure storage and management of backend wallets for transaction processing.
### Details:
Create or import backend wallets within the Engine dashboard. Ensure secure storage practices are followed, such as using AWS KMS or Google Cloud KMS for key management.

## 5. Implement Transaction Monitoring and Webhooks [pending]
### Dependencies: 21.4
### Description: Set up monitoring for transaction statuses and create webhook endpoints to handle Engine callbacks.
### Details:
Configure the FastAPI backend to monitor transaction queues and statuses. Implement webhook endpoints to receive and process callbacks from the Engine for transaction events.

## 6. Handle Concurrent Transactions with Nonce Management [pending]
### Dependencies: 21.5
### Description: Implement mechanisms to manage concurrent transactions and prevent nonce conflicts.
### Details:
Utilize the Engine's built-in nonce management features to handle multiple transactions simultaneously without conflicts. Ensure the FastAPI backend is configured to support concurrent transaction processing.

## 7. Create Agent Wallets with Smart Contracts [pending]
### Dependencies: 21.3
### Description: Develop functionality to create smart contract wallets for each autonomous payment agent.
### Details:
Use the Thirdweb Engine to create smart contract wallets tailored for each agent, ensuring they have the necessary capabilities for autonomous operation.

## 8. Implement Gas Sponsorship for Transactions [pending]
### Dependencies: 21.7
### Description: Enable gas sponsorship capabilities for agent transactions.
### Details:
Configure the Engine to sponsor gas for transactions initiated by agent wallets, ensuring seamless transaction execution without direct gas costs to the agents.

## 9. Enable Multi-Signature Support for High-Value Operations [pending]
### Dependencies: 21.8
### Description: Implement multi-signature functionality for secure handling of high-value transactions.
### Details:
Set up multi-signature requirements for transactions exceeding a certain value threshold, ensuring enhanced security through multiple approvals.
