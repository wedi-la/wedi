## 4. Enable Natural Language Payment Link Creation [pending]
### Dependencies: 19.3
### Description: Develop functionality for users to generate payment links using natural language commands.
### Details:
Implement a feature where users can input natural language requests to create payment links, leveraging the CoAgents' capabilities to interpret and execute these commands.

## 5. Develop Intelligent Route Optimization Agent [pending]
### Dependencies: 19.1
### Description: Create an agent to optimize routing of payment transactions for efficiency and cost-effectiveness.
### Details:
Design an agent that analyzes various routing options for payment transactions, selecting the most efficient and cost-effective paths based on predefined criteria and real-time data.

## 6. Implement Risk Assessment and Fraud Detection Agent [pending]
### Dependencies: 19.1
### Description: Develop an agent to assess risks and detect potential fraudulent activities in payment processes.
### Details:
Create an agent that evaluates transaction data to identify and flag suspicious activities, utilizing machine learning models and predefined rules to enhance security.

## 7. Establish Human-in-the-Loop Approval Workflows [pending]
### Dependencies: 19.3, 19.6
### Description: Set up workflows that require human approval for certain agent decisions.
### Details:
Integrate human-in-the-loop mechanisms where the agent seeks human approval for high-risk or exceptional transactions, ensuring oversight and compliance.

## 8. Implement Agent Performance Monitoring [pending]
### Dependencies: 19.1
### Description: Develop systems to monitor and evaluate the performance of the payment orchestration agent.
### Details:
