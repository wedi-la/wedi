# Task ID: 10
# Title: Implement Webhook Notification System
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 8
# Priority: medium
# Description: Develop a comprehensive webhook system for external notifications.
# Details:
Create APIs for webhook registration and implement event-driven notifications for payment status changes. Ensure secure signature verification.

# Test Strategy:
Test webhook registration and notification delivery by simulating various transaction events and verifying external system updates.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Design Webhook Registration API Endpoints [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create API endpoints that allow clients to register and manage their webhook subscriptions.
### Details:
Develop endpoints for clients to register webhook URLs, specify event types, and manage their subscriptions. Ensure endpoints are secure and validate input data.

## 2. Implement Event Type Subscription Management [pending]
### Dependencies: 10.1
### Description: Develop functionality to manage client subscriptions to specific event types.
### Details:
Allow clients to select and modify the event types they wish to receive notifications for. Ensure the system can handle multiple subscriptions per client and provide mechanisms to update or cancel subscriptions.

## 3. Develop Webhook Delivery System with Retry Logic [pending]
### Dependencies: 10.1, 10.2
### Description: Create a system to deliver webhook events to client endpoints, including robust retry mechanisms.
### Details:
Implement a delivery system that sends events to client URLs. Incorporate exponential backoff with jitter for retries to handle transient failures, and consider a dead-letter queue for undeliverable messages.

## 4. Implement Signature Verification for Security [pending]
### Dependencies: 10.1, 10.3
### Description: Ensure the integrity and authenticity of webhook payloads through signature verification.
### Details:
Generate HMAC signatures for each webhook payload using a shared secret. Clients should verify these signatures to confirm the payload's authenticity and integrity. ([snyk.io](https://snyk.io/blog/creating-secure-webhooks/?utm_source=openai))

## 5. Define Webhook Event Payload Formatting [pending]
### Dependencies: 10.1, 10.2
### Description: Standardize the structure and content of webhook event payloads.
### Details:
Design a consistent and clear payload format that includes necessary event details, timestamps, and unique identifiers to ensure idempotency and facilitate client processing.

## 6. Implement Delivery Status Tracking and Monitoring [pending]
### Dependencies: 10.3
### Description: Create mechanisms to track and monitor the delivery status of webhook events.
### Details:
Log all delivery attempts, responses, and failures. Provide tools for monitoring delivery metrics and alerting on issues to ensure timely detection and resolution of problems.

## 7. Apply Rate Limiting and Circuit Breaker Patterns [pending]
### Dependencies: 10.3, 10.6
### Description: Implement rate limiting and circuit breaker patterns to protect the system from overload and failures.
### Details:
Set rate limits on outgoing webhook deliveries to prevent overwhelming client systems. Implement circuit breakers to halt delivery attempts to endpoints that consistently fail, resuming only after a defined recovery period.
